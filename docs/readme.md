## Har2Postman
### What is it for?
Har2Postman is a javascript library that converts HAR files into Postman collections, useful for automatic HTTP request and optionally including tests that assert the correct response from the URL called.

The HTTP Archive format, or [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)), is a JSON-formatted archive file format for logging of a web browser's interaction with a site. Browsers like Firefox or Chrome can export HAR files form the network monitoring tab in the developer tools.

On the other hand, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a testing API client tool, allowing us to test a request against a specific environment. The tool includes the posibility of coding assertions on the response in order to check the correct behaviour of an API.

### How can I use it?
Har2Postman is a library. That means you can use it in any project that you think it might be useful. Just for demo purposes, you can find a converter below in this same page.
